# Download

Apart from the Smalltalk packages, the downloads contain the documentation, Java classes with source code, and a helper library with C source code which is necessary only for JNIPort 2. These files are needed for running the tests for JNIPort and for using callbacks from Java to Smalltalk.

- The Dolphin Smalltalk versions for Dolphin Smalltalk 5 and Dolphin Smalltalk 6 can be downloaded below. Both archives include the full documentation for JNIPort for Dolphin Smalltalk and archives with Java code needed for using callbacks and for running the tests.

- The VisualWorks version of JNIPort is available in Cincom's Public Store Repository and from the respective folder below. Instructions for loading JNIPort from the Public Store Repository are here. If you load JNIPort for VisualWorks from the Public Store Repository, the files are attached to the bundle named "JNIPort" and will be copied to your file system when you load the bundle.
