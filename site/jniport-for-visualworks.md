# JNIPort for VisualWorks

Please read Chris Uppal's documentation of JNIPort for Dolphin Smalltalk which is included both in the JNIPort bundle in Cincom's Public Store Repository and in the [download of JNIPort for Dolphin Smalltalk](file-cabinet.md). It contains a detailed description of the concepts and design of JNIPort, as well as several examples and tips. Although it is written on the background of Dolphin Smalltalk, most of the documentation is valid for VisualWorks as well.
